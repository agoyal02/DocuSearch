        "abstract": "When pre-trained on large unsupervised textual corpora, language models are able to store and retrieve factual knowledge to some extent, making it possible to use them directly for zero-shot cloze-style question answering. However, storing factual knowledge in a fixed number of weights of a language model clearly has limitations. Previous approaches have successfully provided access to information outside the model weights using supervised architectures that combine an information retrieval system with a machine reading component. In this paper, we go a step further and integrate information from a retrieval system with a pre-trained language model in a purely unsupervised way. We report that augmenting pre-trained language models in this way dramatically improves performance and that the resulting system, despite being unsupervised, is competitive with a supervised machine reading baseline. Furthermore, processing query and context with different segment tokens allows BERT to utilize its Next Sentence Prediction pre-trained classifier to determine whether the context is relevant or not, substantially improving BERT's zeroshot cloze-style question-answering performance and making its predictions robust to noisy contexts.",

        "abstract": "In facing industry revolution 4.0, utilizing advanced information and computer technology in educational environment is crucial. One of the advanced computation technologies that can be used for learning, especially language learning, is chatbot. Chatbot is a computer program based on artificial intelligence that can carry out conversations through audio or text. This study intends to find out and analyze the types of artificial intelligence in the form of chatbots and the possibility of their use as language learning medium. The data in this study obtained from literature review on chatbot researches, and from observation results on chatbot-based language learning medium developed by the author. The results indicated that chatbots have a high potential to be used as a language learning medium, both as tutor in practicing language, and as independent learning medium. Moreover, research results revealed that language learners are interested in using chatbots because they can be used anytime and anywhere, and they are more confident in learning languages using chatbots than when dealing directly with human tutors.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of widely-used artificial intelligence (AI) has created a critical need for AI expertise, not just as a research area but for workers in the wide variety of careers and roles that AI disrupts. While AI is still an area of research for new processing, application, and development -it continues to partially automate, augment, or replace many of the tasks which are performed through active use of human hands. While recently publicized items such as ChatGPT and MidJourney have made press in their adjustment to writing and image generation technology, the basic workflow of copyeditors and digital artists was completely transformed, inside of the year, to a combination of partially automated or fully automated AI tasks. While some blame AI as part of the \"problem\", it is naturally part of the \"solution\" -AI tools to help workers develop AI competencies. The paper describes an array of strategies which the DoD and its ICT UARC are using to address the fundamental problem of quickly upskilling the DoD workforce of over 2 million adult learners.",
