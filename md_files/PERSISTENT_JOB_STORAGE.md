# Persistent Job Storage Implementation

## Overview
Implemented persistent storage for job status and results to ensure job information is retained even when the application restarts.

## Key Features

### 1. Dual Storage System
- **Job Metadata**: Stored in `job_metadata/` directory as JSON files
- **Job Results**: Stored in `job_results/` directory as JSONL files

### 2. Automatic Loading
- Jobs are automatically loaded from both metadata and results files on application startup
- Existing jobs are restored with full status and results information

### 3. Real-time Persistence
- Job metadata is saved after every update (progress, file results, completion)
- Job results are saved in JSONL format for easy parsing and analysis

## File Structure

```
job_metadata/
├── {job_id}.json          # Job metadata and status
job_results/
├── job_{job_id}_results.jsonl  # Detailed job results
```

## API Endpoints

### GET /jobs
Returns list of all jobs with summary information:
```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "job_id": "271945c6",
      "status": "Completed",
      "progress_percentage": 100,
      "total_files": 3,
      "successful_files": 0,
      "failed_files": 3,
      "skipped_files": 0,
      "processing_time": 0.000319,
      "start_time": "2025-09-16T20:44:07.533700",
      "end_time": "2025-09-16T20:44:07.534019"
    }
  ]
}
```

### GET /job_results/{job_id}
Returns detailed job results including individual file processing results:
```json
{
  "job_id": "271945c6",
  "status": "Completed",
  "total_files": 3,
  "successful_files": 0,
  "failed_files": 3,
  "results": [
    {
      "filename": "docs/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf",
      "success": false,
      "error": "File not found",
      "timestamp": "2025-09-16T20:44:07.533904"
    }
  ]
}
```

### GET /job_results/{job_id}/download
Downloads job results as JSONL file for external analysis.

## Implementation Details

### Job Manager Enhancements
- Added `_load_existing_jobs()` method to load jobs on startup
- Added `_save_job_metadata()` method for real-time persistence
- Enhanced `_load_job_results_from_file()` to reconstruct jobs from results
- Added fallback values for missing fields in loaded jobs

### Data Persistence
- Job metadata saved after every update operation
- Job results saved in JSONL format with summary and individual results
- Automatic creation of required directories

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing or corrupted job files
- Fallback values for missing job fields
- Error logging for debugging

## Benefits

1. **Persistence**: Jobs survive application restarts
2. **Reliability**: No data loss during maintenance or crashes
3. **Analytics**: Historical job data available for analysis
4. **Debugging**: Complete job history for troubleshooting
5. **Scalability**: Jobs can be processed in batches and tracked over time

## Usage

The persistent job storage works automatically:
1. Jobs are created and tracked in real-time
2. All job updates are immediately persisted
3. On application restart, all previous jobs are loaded
4. Job status and results remain available via API endpoints

This ensures that users can always access their job history and results, even after application restarts or system maintenance.
